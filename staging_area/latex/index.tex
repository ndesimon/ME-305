\hypertarget{index_sec_intro}{}\doxysection{Introduction}\label{index_sec_intro}
My name is Nicholas De Simone, and this portfolio contains documentation for various mechatronics lab projects from my time as a mechanical engineering student at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. These projects involve various hardware mechanisms, such as PMDC/servo motors, quadrature encoders, inertial measurement units, and the like, driven by Python source code written for microcontrollers (specifically the Nucleo L476). Through these projects, my lab teams and I were able to practice object-\/oriented and task-\/based asynchronous programming, serial communication, etc. Please reference any associated links to source code and demonstration videos for further information.\hypertarget{index_sec_305pro}{}\doxysection{ME 305 Projects}\label{index_sec_305pro}
\hypertarget{index_sub_labT}{}\doxysubsection{Term Project\+: Ball-\/\+Balancing Platform}\label{index_sub_labT}
Our ME 305 Term Project was a culmination of Labs 1-\/5 described below. The goal of the term project was to incorporate closed-\/loop control, communication with resistive touch panel and IMU devices, and serial user-\/ input over the USB VCP port of our Nucleo MCU in order to balance a steel ball atop a rotating platform. See \mbox{\hyperlink{labtermpage_8py}{Term Project\+: Ball-\/\+Balancing Platform}} for more details.

\hypertarget{index_sub_lab1}{}\doxysubsection{Lab 1\+: LED Light Show}\label{index_sub_lab1}
Our introduction to micro\+Python-\/based programming in ME 305. This lab consisted of writing a finite state machine script to display three LED pulse patterns on the Nucleo\textquotesingle{}s native LED. See \mbox{\hyperlink{lab1page_8py}{Lab 1\+: LED Light Show}} for more details. ~\newline
\hypertarget{index_sub_lab2}{}\doxysubsection{Lab 2\+: Incremental Encoders}\label{index_sub_lab2}
Lab 2 implements task and class Python files to read quadrature encoder pulse signals and interpret them as the angular position of a motor shaft. See \mbox{\hyperlink{lab2page_8py}{Lab 2\+: Incremental Encoders}} for more details.\hypertarget{index_sub_lab3}{}\doxysubsection{Lab 3\+: DC Motor Control}\label{index_sub_lab3}
Lab 3 uses pulse width modulation to control DC motors, as well as reads from the attached quadrature encoders from Lab 2. See \mbox{\hyperlink{lab3page_8py}{Lab 3\+: DC Motor Control}} for more details.\hypertarget{index_sub_lab4}{}\doxysubsection{Lab 4\+: Closed-\/\+Loop Speed Control}\label{index_sub_lab4}
Lab 4 builds on Labs 2 and 3 with additional task-\/ and driver-\/files to perform closed-\/loop speed control on the DC motors of Lab 3. See \mbox{\hyperlink{lab4page_8py}{Lab 4\+: Closed-\/\+Loop Speed Control}} for more details.\hypertarget{index_sub_lab5}{}\doxysubsection{Lab 5\+: I2\+C and Inertial Measurement Unit}\label{index_sub_lab5}
Lab 5 reads angular position and velocity data from an inertial measurement unit (specifically, the Bosch BNO055) attached to our platform. This data is implemented as feedback in the closed-\/loop controller of Lab 4, with the goal of stabilizing the platform relative to the direction of gravity. See \mbox{\hyperlink{lab5page_8py}{Lab 5\+: I2C and Inertial Measurement Unit}} for more details.\hypertarget{index_sec_sen}{}\doxysection{Senior Project}\label{index_sec_sen}
