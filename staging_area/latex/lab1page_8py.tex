Blink the Nucleo L476 LED in three patterns.\hypertarget{lab2page_8py_sec_intro2}{}\doxysection{Introduction}\label{lab2page_8py_sec_intro2}
Lab 1 served as an introduction to writing Python scripts to be run on a microcontroller. Our team wrote a finite state machine program that is able to be run on a Nucleo L476 MCU. The goal of the program is to display three LED pulse patterns on the Nucleo\textquotesingle{}s native LED, located on pin PA5. By clicking the Nucleo\textquotesingle{}s blue user button, the user is able to cycle through the following three LED patterns\+: (1) square wave (2) sine wave and (3) sawtooth wave. Please see \mbox{\hyperlink{lab1page_8py_sec_files1}{Project Files}} for descriptions about our project file.\hypertarget{lab1page_8py_sec_vid1}{}\doxysection{Demonstration Video}\label{lab1page_8py_sec_vid1}

Our Lab 1 script, \mbox{\hyperlink{_l_e_d___patterns_8py}{LED\+\_\+\+Patterns.\+py}}, changes the LD2 LED light of the Nucleo L476 according to the following three waveforms\+: (1) square (2) sine and (3) sawtooth. The user is able to press the blue user button on the Nucleo in order to cycle through those three LED patterns. See \mbox{\hyperlink{_l_e_d___patterns_8py}{LED\+\_\+\+Patterns.\+py}} for more information.
